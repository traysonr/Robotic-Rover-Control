Code that will drive the Abel 2.0 rover via arduino or raspberry pi


The Abel2.0 rover chassis is a wheeled, remote control robot that can be driven with code supplied by arduino, raspberry pi, or other RF hardware.

The code is written to drive the bot with GPIO pins I have selected.  Changing these to suit your project shouldn't be too difficult.

The code supplied on this repository illustrates how to control the rover via webpage, smartphone, and bluetooth.
